# Cursor
The ````Cursor```` object is used to read and extract from strings in a more structured and beautiful fashion.

The Cursor object is designed to operate completely without any independence on ````Text````.

To initialize a ``Cursor`` you simply construct the class with a required string argument.
```php
use Markhj\Text\Cursor;

$cursor = new Cursor('Here is some example text');
```
